    <p>
      A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In
      other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from
      an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a
      function is created, at function creation time. Closure gives our
      functions persistent memories and an entirely new toolkit for writing
      professional code.

    <p>Here are some practical applications of closures:</p>
    <ul className='closure-list'>
      <li>
        Helper functions: Everyday professional helper functions like 'once' and
        'memoize'
      </li>
      <li>
        Iterators and generators: Which use lexical scoping and closure to
        achieve the most contemporary patterns for handling data in Javascript
      </li>
      <li>
        Module pattern: Preserve state for the life of an application without
        polluting the global namespace
      </li>
      <li>
        Asynchronous Javascript: Callbacks and Promises rely on closure to
        persist state in an asynchronous environment
      </li>
    </ul>
  </React.Fragment>
