    <p>
      A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In
      other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from
      an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a
      function is created, at function creation time.
